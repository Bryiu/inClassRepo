THE DAILY TACO

APPLICATION SUMMARY (let's taco about it):

The Daily Taco is a functioning application that allows the user to randomly generate
a taco with 5 key components -  Base Layer, Mixin, Condiment, Seasoning and Shell. If the user is not pleased with one of the key componetes they can then randomize for a new selection of the entire taco or just that key element.

This application also lets the user pick their favorite Alcohol type (gin, vodka, whiskey, etc.) and pairs a drink with the taco they have settled on. Not only is the user given the ingredients, but they get a step by step recipie on how to make this taco and drink. 

This makes the perfect match to bring to any party, date night, or lazy day you can think of. 

FUTURE OBJECTIVES:

- once the user is set on the taco and drink they have selected an added feature will bring 
up two options:
    -Instacart's website will be linked so one can order select ingredients and get it delivered. 
    -Google maps with nearest grocery stores and liquor stores.
